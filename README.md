    - HLS/GLSL shaders
    - Console/Log system
    - Skeletal and morph animation(with 3DS max export plugin)
    - Binary mesh loading(with 3DS max export plugin)
    - Particle rendering(with Experemental OpenCL Support)
    - XML based scene loading format
    - Post-processing with using configurable XML based file format.
    - Hardware and software occlusion culling
    - KTX/DDS/PVR texture format support
    - GPU occlusion culling (with Experemental OpenCL Support)

    - Shader system
    - Batch objects rendering using configurable description is XML based file format
    - Lua script support for scripting behaviour of objects using state mach
    
    
 ## The future plans
    - Vulkan/Direct3D12 render system
    - Deferred rendering
    - Extend Post process system for SSAO
    - Fix stability and varius bugs
    
## Move3D Engine uses the following third-party libraries:

- pugixml (https://github.com/zeux/pugixml)
- Lua (https://github.com/lua/lua)
